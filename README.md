Simulator for the Small Demonstration Machine.

Please not that this machine does not yet (and may never) have a physical form, and that this instruction set is of my own design. As it is purely for demonstration purposes, it will never do anything useful, or be marketed, unless I accidentally get sent back in time to around 1950, where this machine could actually compete.
